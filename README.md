Subject: Request for Course Certification

Dear HR,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve completed the Maximizing Success: Mastering the Art of Goal Setting on Coursera, as assigned by the company, within the 15-day timeline. I’ve also prepared the required notes and tasks.

However, to submit the course certificate, I need to purchase it, and I currently can’t afford the cost. I kindly request the company to sponsor this certification for me so that I can meet all the requirements and contribute better with the knowledge I’ve gained.

Thank you for your support. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards, 
Vinayak Padhyavani
